# Personalized-Cancer-Diagnosis

The workflow is as follows

* A molecular pathologist selects a list of genetic variations of interest that he/she want to analyze
* The molecular pathologist searches for evidence in the medical literature that somehow are relevant to the genetic variations of interest
* Finally this molecular pathologist spends a huge amount of time analyzing the evidence related to each of the variations to classify them.

Our goal here is to replace step 3 by a machine learning model. The molecular pathologist will still have to decide which variations are of interest, and also collect the relevant evidence for them. But the last step, which is also the most time consuming, will be fully automated.
